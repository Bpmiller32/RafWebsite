                RAF’s advancements in neural network research and development is
                a game changer! Conventional ICR engines often require
                tailor-made algorithms and adjustments to utilize automatic text
                recognition for different languages; accounting for people’s
                different handwriting styles, text slant; as well as dealing
                with technical imaging issues, e.g. camera position, camera
                angle, uneven illumination etc.
              </p>
              <p class="mt-4">
                RAF’s SmartScript neural networks utilize a multi-layered
                learning approach whereby each neuron (node) in each layer
                contains information passed from other nodes seamlessly
                connected which provides a high degree of accuracy in both
                spotting text regions and deciphering characters simultaneously.
              </p>

              <p class="mt-4">
                As a result, no product on the market today can match
                SmartScript’s extraordinarily high read rate performance with
                the lowest error rates and do so in timeframes never seen
                before. SmartScript also sets a new benchmark in performance by
                detecting names and building unit numbers so both full address
                reading as well as move updates can also take place.
