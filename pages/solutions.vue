                A solution that converts the intensive array of information that
                appears on parcels into actionable data. We use a simple and
                methodical process using the industry’s most advanced neural
                network algorithms that decodes each piece of information to
                allow automation to both read and leverage this for the
                operator. This revolutionary process and product is called
                Parcel Vision. Parcel Vision is the product customers have been
                searching for to address all their parcel automation
                requirements.

                    RAF’s advancements in neural network research and
                    development is a game changer! Conventional ICR engines
                    often require tailor-made algorithms and adjustments to
                    utilize automatic text recognition for different languages;
                    accounting for people’s different handwriting styles, text
                    slant; as well as dealing with technical imaging issues,
                    e.g. camera position, camera angle, uneven illumination etc.

                  <p class="mt-8">
                    RAF’s SmartScript neural networks utilize a multi-layered
                    learning approach whereby each neuron (node) in each layer
                    contains information passed from other nodes seamlessly
                    connected which provides a high degree of accuracy in both
                    spotting text regions and deciphering characters
                    simultaneously.

                    To meet the growing demand for leading edge solutions
                    BlueCrest and RAF Technology have jointly developed an
                    advanced product portfolio that enables innovative postal
                    operators to both enhance their core letter mail business as
                    well as capture a greater share of the booming parcel
                    market. BlueCrest recently deployed its new Vantage sorters
                    to modernize the postal networks for both Correios Brazil
                    and Croatia Post. These organizations chose BlueCrest and
                    RAF Technology as they needed the best turnkey solution
                    offering highly efficient, fast hardware with the most
                    advanced software. The rapid deployment resulted in enhanced
                    network capacity and efficiency on the ground in short
                    order.

                    These solutions included such critical attributes as full
                    address machine print OCR, full address handwriting ICR,
                    full name recognition on machine and handwriting addresses
                    to provide mover’s functionality, mail facing, complete
                    directory redesign to create more precise match rates, mail
                    type recognition for special handling requirements, and
                    address learning systems for continuous directory
                    improvement, among others. BlueCrest also deployed its
                    VariSort transport which is specifically designed to allow
                    operators to expand their operation and offer new
                    competitive products to their customers in the high growth
                    e-commerce flats and small parcel delivery business.
